# Minion [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iobio/minion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iobio/minion) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/iobio/minion/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/iobio/minion?branch=master)
iobio server that easily turns a command line program into an iobio web service.

## Description
Minion is the server side code that powers all iobio web services. It wraps a command line program and hooks the
input files/streams and stdout streams to websocket streams, enabling multiple web services to be piped together. It also handles
converting the URL into a command and error handling. If you are wanting run a particular iobio webservice see the minion-services repo.

## Web Services
iobio is made up of numerous micro web services that are each capable of supporting multiple apps. These web services can be mixed and matched to create a wide range of functionality. In this way a new web app can grab a set of relevant web services and then build a UI and visualization around them.

#### Public Web Services
You can develop apps against our public web services but due to resource constraints we can only run a set number of concurrent requests. Requests that can not be processed immediately are placed in a queue and processed in turn. If you need more power, you can install the web services yourself or contact us. All public services are located at https://github.com/iobio/minion-services

#### Local Install
If you need to install webservices locally there are two ways to do it
###### Directly
For testing it's often easier to install minion directly and place your required services in the service directory. First [install minion](#download) then place your web service definition file in the ```minion/services/``` directory. A list of web service definition files can be found in the [minion-services](https://github.com/iobio/minion-services) repo. Lastly you'll need to copy the tool you are turning into a web service into the ```minion/bin/``` directory or it won't run ([see create your own web service for more details](#create-your-own-web-service)).
```
// where someService is the service definition file for a tool (e.g. samtools) you want to turn into a webservice
cd minion/
mv someService.js minion/services/
// start service
node services/someService.js
```
###### Docker
For production you may want to use [dockerized containers](http://iobio.io/2015/07/05/install-locally-via-docker/)

## Developers
If you want to improve minion or create your own webservice, you'll want to download and install minion itself.

#### Download
To get going you need to clone the repo from github
```
git clone https://github.com/iobio/minion.git
```

#### Install Dependencies
This will install all needed node modules
```
cd minion; npm install
```

#### Run Tests

```
npm test
```

#### Config File
Minion services can take a config file on startup. Otherwise the default config file ```lib/config.js``` will be used.

###### To use config file
```
node someService.js --config file.config
```
###### Example config file
```JavaScript
// Minion Config file


var config = {
        platform : 'default',                   // 'default' returns nothing. 'amazon' will use amazon dns lookup to get hostname so you can use ssl
        maxConcurrentCommands: null,    // accepts a number or null. null allows unlimimited commands
        noQueueDomains: ['localhost', 'iobio.io', null], // lists domains that will never be queued
        cacheDir: 'cache'
}

module.exports = config;
```

#### Create Your Own Web Service
Minion wraps command line tools and converts them into iobio web services that are instantly pluggable into the iobio ecosystem.

##### Simple example
For this example we will create a service from the linux utility wc to count lines, words, and characters.

###### Create the iobio service wrapper file
Create a new file called ```wc-iobio.js``` in ```minion/services/``` and paste the following js into it.

```javascript
var port = 4003,
    minion = require('../index.js')(port);


// define tool
var tool = {
   apiVersion : "0.1",
   name : 'wc',
   path :  'wc',
   description : 'count lines, words, characters',
   exampleUrl : "http://0.0.0.0:4003/?cmd=http%253A%252F%252Fs3.amazonaws.com%252Fiobio%252Fjasmine_files%252Ftest.minion.txt"
};

// start minion socket
minion.listen(tool);
console.log('iobio server started on port ' + port);

```

###### Add tool into whitelisted directory
For security iobio only allows the execution of programs in the minion/bin directory so to enable execution of the wc utility a sym link needs to be created there. To create the symlink run the following command line. If wc is not at ```/usr/bin/``` then you can find it's location with ```which wc```.

```
$ cd minion/bin; ln -s /usr/bin/wc wc
```

###### Test new service

Start up server
```
node services/wc-iobio.js
```

To quickly test the new service, you can paste this url in the browser
```
http://0.0.0.0:4003/?cmd=http%253A%252F%252Fs3.amazonaws.com%252Fiobio%252Fjasmine_files%252Ftest.minion.txt
```

This will run the file at ```https://s3.amazonaws.com/iobio/jasmine_files/test.minion.txt``` through the wc web service. You should get back ```1 6 28```

###### Use new service
To seriously use this service, you'll want to use the ```iobio.js``` library which will create iobio urls and manage websocket connections. Here's an example

```html
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<script src='iobio.js'></script>
		<script>

			// encode URL to tell the wc web service this is a input source and not a command line parameter
			// This is temporary and will be incoporated into the library
			var url = encodeURIComponent('http://s3.amazonaws.com/iobio/jasmine_files/test.minion.txt');

			// Create command
			var cmd = new iobio.cmd(
		        '0.0.0.0:4003/',
		        [url], // parameters
		        { 'urlparams': {'protocol':'http'} } // use http option since input origin is a http server and not a iobio web service
		    );

		    cmd.on('data', function(results) {
				console.log(results);
				alert(results);
			})

			cmd.on('error', function(error) { console.log(error); })

			cmd.run();
		</script>
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
	</html>
```

To add parameters, add them as you would any iobio command. Here we add the ```-c``` option to only get back characters
```javascript
  // Create command
  var cmd = new iobio.cmd(
  	'0.0.0.0:4003/',
    ['-c', url],
    { 'urlparams': {'protocol':'http'} } // use http sense input origin is a http server and not a iobio web service
  );
```


##### Tool with sub-programs
./sometool subprogram --flag1 arg1
```javascript
var tool = {
   apiVersion : "0.1",
   name : 'sometool',
   path: 'sometool/' // path to directory where subprograms live
}
```

##### CacheTransform
cacheTransform allows a stream to be piped through a transform pipe before being cached. Here's an example of using the [last-record-stream utility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/last-record-stream) to cache only the last record coming back from bamstatsalive

```JavaScript
var tool = {
   apiVersion : "0.1",
   name : 'bamstatsalive',
   path :  'bamstatsalive',
   cacheTransform: lastRecord
};
```
